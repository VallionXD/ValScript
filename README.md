# ValScript - Script Hub
> A custom script hub using a interface based on the minecraft hacked client vape lite. *Credits to [dawid-scripts](https://github.com/dawid-scripts) for making the entire original library.*

If you want to use our library for yourself please see the [Interface Section](https://github.com/VallionXD/ValScript/tree/main/Interface).

## Latest Script.
> To load the latest version paste the script into your executor, So far we currently do not have an universal script and do not plan to add one.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VallionXD/ValScript/main/Loader.lua"))()
```

### Games Supported.
> Currently the script is not finished, so no games are supported at the moment.


## Extra Scripts.
> This is where we post some extra scripts we make. Currently there are none.
